# Employees Database Design

I spearheaded the development of a comprehensive database schema, meticulously designing tables optimized for efficient data storage, query performance, and analytical flexibility. Following the schema design, I executed the data integration process by importing the CSV files into a PostgreSQL database. This process involved data validation, cleansing, and transformation to ensure the integrity and usability of the historical employee data within a relational database environment.
