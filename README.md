# Background
It’s a beautiful spring day, and it’s been two weeks since you were hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard. Your first major task is a research project on employees of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the database of employees from that period are six CSV files.

So for this project, I designed tables to hold data from the CSV files, and import the CSV files into a PostgreSQL database
